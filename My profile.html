<h2>Interested in IT</h2>

<p>My interest about IT is how it makes life better and more convenient. I am the kind of guy who always searching for new ways and solutions to make it easy and fastest as possible. We used to have to store our paper and documents on the shelf and now it can be store in your devices like smartphones and computers. Will it be amazing when you can be anywhere else besides home and buy food in the supermarket without actually go there? Or using social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat to contact each other and also organize your social life. When I was young, I used to spend hours playing video games and discover new stuff on the internet. One day, I found a video about people who use code to make machines understand and work for them, that when I know I have a passion for this IT field. And my interest got sparked when I first uses C++ to code the robot which I can control it using a remote to make it do as I wanted when I was grade 10 studying abroad. Although it is very hard for me because I was late for admission for 2 terms but that not stopping me from my interest in coding. </p>

<p>The reason that I choose RMIT university because of 2 reasons: Education style and global opportunity. In RMIT, I can learn my degree from the teacher from many famous schools in the world and who has expertise directly with my programs. And, when I study hear, I have a chance to study abroad because this school is in the top 5 universities for international exchange. Based on my interest, I will have a global opportunity to work for many famous companies all over the world. Another reason that I come here to study because they have the same type of teaching in my previous school so that I can adapt quickly and learn faster with the help of school teachers and lecturers.  </p>

<p>During the course, I expected to learn more about Python and more about coding languages such as C+, C++, and more about the fundamentals of coding. After finish studying, I expect to master at least one coding language and discover more fields of IT such like learn more about coding languages, know how to code using Python to create cool stuff like artificial intelligence, making a game, or make something more complex like bot for many purposes. In my opinion, this should help me to succeed in the future and gain more experience in the job soon. <p>

It will be helpful for the people who have higher education in the required field or previous work experience. Because of the nature of work, fluency/understanding of some specific programming languages (Java, PHP, or Python,...) and operating system is a skill must-have. Another skill that also requires for the candidate is the web development cycle, programming techniques and tools are required. A back-end developer is the last person to check and correct the code from the front-end developer in the limited time, the candidate has to focus on efficiency, user experience, and process improvement and time management is the 2 important skill to be recruited. The person who recruited need to have the ability to work independently or with a group from orders to make a good work.</p>

<p> The result of the tests gives me the information about my personality, my learning style, and how creativity I am. The personality tests help me to measure how effective I am when performed at the group project. Based on my communication skills, motivation, and inspiration, it will be efficiently for me to choose my role. A learning style test show how efficiently I study based strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. And knowing myself is the key to success from the best of my ability. The creativity test helps me determine whether if I have anything related to creativity which will benefit me from problem-solving and thinking creatively </p>

<p> The results will influence my behavior in a team. Based on the result, it will be better to understand other people in the group to better performance. After taking the test, I can understand my strengths and weaknesses which lead to understanding what situations allow me to perform my best. The benefit of knowing my learning style is to increase my confidence and self-respect and help me fulfilling my role that needs to be done. The creativity test will increase my interaction with teammates, boost my passion and productivity. It also makes me improve my motivation and problem solving, which are 2 main factors needed to be a good teammate. </p>

<p> If we know our strengths and weaknesses, it will help us shape our's role within a project and get the best result. The key to success is to communicate, by knowing each individual learning style, we will communicate more effectively within the group to find the best way to solve the problem. Just like learning style tests, creativity inspires each member to communicate each time they have a new ideal,they seek out to each other for their feedback and these are the most important benefit of creativity. When looking for a group member of a team, I should consider all the factors from above to create a successful group.</p>

<h2> Project Idea </h2>

<p> The world today is more and more modern, so there are more and more new technologies to serve people. To develop the skills, earning more experience and knowledge required to qualify for my ideal job, making a website about famous local street food in many countries around the world. I think my ideal will be attracting many people because tourism is a potential industry and satisfied desire to explore their unique culture. Although it sounds like a cool idea to make, it will be hard for me to create an attractive website with many features because I am lack experience. Besides that, there will be a lot of obstacles like Overused stock images and icons; textures, and color; and I might be designed the website for the wrong reason. My motivation about street food website come from myself, a person who loves eating snack and street food itself. Every day, I would like to enjoy a small snack in a break or in my free time, especially when traveling cause I want to discover the street food culture in the place where I am traveling. And I think it will be convenient for the tourist and backpacker to discover the culinary background of that place. After all, we travel to discover a new place, enjoy the moment with our family and wonderful local food. According to Traveling Cook, last year, there are approximately 1.45 billion people travel around the world, and with the humongous number, the food consumption will be uncountable. When people access my website, they will see an easy navigation website with an attractive design and relevant content. Because of that, I will try my best to create a website to meet customers' needs. My top priority when creating a website is to make it easy navigation. To do that, I have created a clear and legible website with a deep understanding of customers and products. Plus the search engine and divided my article into small pieces, will be more convenient for customers to find what they looking for and understand how my site is organized. Attractive design will be one of the features I need to pay attention to because it will be a very effective tool for me to communicate with potential customers and marketing. My website will be simple and creative, combine with a smart choice of color selection and loading time optimized, it will be very competitive for other websites which have the same content as me. The website's content is going to be select from the best source and refinement to create healthy feedback and preview, all to make customers satisfied with the quality of what they looking for. Besides the 3 important elements that I listed, there still some more elements that I still missing and improve some of the features. Because my website mainly about street food, I add a map link so anyone who wants to show their food can put the location of it for other people to discover. I will create and improve a "recommend" section, so when the customers visit the new places, they will have enough information about all the famous dishes in that location. That will to cooperate from my website to the local shops to make it more convenient for the customer. The " maybe you will want to visit " section will be a feature that gives the customer more about the famous places they would love to travel. For the people who want the recipe of the food, I will make a " recipe " section below the selected food that they want to create again, if they don't have enough ingredients, the system will suggest similar ingredients which have a similar taste. This section will link to the map of the nearest market and compare prices between them to give the customer advantage to choose the freshest and most affordable ingredients. To create a website as I wanted, I will need a strong PC that can run multiple coding languages such as Python, Java, CSS, and Django. Because I still lack the experience to make a website, open-source website building tools will be very helpful for me cause I can take it as an example to create my version. Some open-source I can look up online like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. I also found that is a similar website that I can take it as my examplar for my project is https://www.tasteatlas.com/search. It gives the customer information of the signature dishes all around the world. I can learn a lot of new things and I will try to improve some features to create my unique website about streetfood. The skills needed for my project are proficient in using programming language, debugging, and cooperate. It will take me a lot of time to fully understand and master a programming language so will slowly master that by working and studying at the same time to earn more experience. Debugging also an important skill that I need to have when come to making a website, it is the most important skill I need to learn. To make it possible, I need to increase my code reading skill to find what is wrong, what is missing; and expand my knowledge to understand deeper what problem I'm facing. Cooperate with other people is the key to success, I must communicate and comprehend with each other team member to make the best result. The final result that I and my team worked hard for is a fully functional website that can run. By running a trial run and learning from our mistake, the original problem will be easily solved by time. And hopefully, the final product runs smoothly and popular with the targeted customers.</p>
